COVID Case Management System

Project Overview:
Developed a comprehensive COVID-19 case management system in Python, integrated with a database to manage and analyze pandemic data. The system allows for the entry, retrieval, correction, and statistical analysis of COVID-related data.

Key Features:

Data Entry Portal: Facilitated the reporting and updating of COVID cases, including tracking of active cases and deceased individuals.
Information Portal: Implemented detailed search functionality for retrieving personal and case-related details, including filters by district, local body, age group, gender, and date.
Data Correction: Enabled data rectification by allowing deletion and modification of records based on Aadhaar ID.
Statistical Analysis: Developed modules to calculate Test Positivity Rate (TPR) and Weekly Infection Population Ratio (WIPR), providing critical metrics for pandemic tracking.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed a menu-driven console interface for easy navigation across different functionalities.
Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language used to develop the system.
SQLite/MySQL: Backend database to store and retrieve COVID-related data.
SQL: Used for executing queries to interact with the database.
Impact:

Streamlined the management of COVID data, providing real-time insights and facilitating quick decision-making during the pandemic.
Reduced manual effort in tracking and updating case records, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
